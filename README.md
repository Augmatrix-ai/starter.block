### Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root of the project where the `Dockerfile` is located.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-docker-username/your-image-name:tag .
   ```
   Replace `your-docker-username`, `your-image-name`, and `tag` with appropriate values.

### Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub
To push the Docker image to Docker Hub, execute the following steps:

1. Log in to your Docker Hub account using the command:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
2. Push the built image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker push your-docker-username/your-image-name:tag
   ```
   Ensure you replace the placeholders with your actual Docker Hub username, image name, and tag.
