# Project Title

## Introduction
This project is designed to create customosized block componentes(PdfOcr, Split Pdf, ....) like these components can be done very easily by using this basic starter package. It includes the following components:
```bash 
├── README.md
├── client.py
├── deployment
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── entrypoint.sh
├── main.py
├── requirments.txt
├── structure.json
├── testdata
│   └── single_pdf.pdf
└── unittests
    └── __init__.py
```
- `client.py`: this file will help to check the connection of the code with server
- `main.py`: this the server file which can help to 
- `deployment/`:
  - `Dockerfile`: [Explain the contents and purpose of the Dockerfile]
  - `entrypoint.sh`: [Briefly describe the role of the entrypoint script]
- `requirments.txt`: [List the dependencies required for running the project]
- `structure.json`: [Explain the significance of this JSON file]
- `testdata/`:
  - `single_pdf.pdf`: [Specify the purpose of the test PDF file]
- `unittests/`:
  - `__init__.py`: [Briefly describe the purpose of this file]

## Docker Image Building and Pushing to Docker Hub

### Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root of the project where the `Dockerfile` is located.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -f deployment/Dockerfile -t <your-image-name>:<tag.
   ```
   Replace  `your-image-name`, and `tag` with appropriate values.

### Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub
To push the Docker image to Docker Hub, execute the following steps:

1. Log in to your Docker Hub account using the command:
   ```bash
   docker login registry.augmatrix.ai 
   ```
2. Tag you Docker image with respect to the  docker registry 
	```bash 
	docker tag <your-image-name>:<tag registry.augmatrix.ai/<your-image-name>:<tag>>
	```
3. Push the built image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker push registry.augmatrix.ai/<your-image-name>:<tag>
   ```
   Ensure you replace the placeholders with your actual Docker Hub username, image name, and tag.

Now, your Docker image is available on Docker Hub and can be pulled by others.
